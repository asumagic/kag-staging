# Important compatibility information

## 64-bit requirement

You now need a 64-bit operating system to run KAG (both on Linux and on Windows). This is almost always the case already, but it is worth mentioning.  
This comes with simpler tooling support for us and enhances performance.

This means that on Linux you do not need to install 32-bit compatibility libraries in order to run the standalone game or a dedicated server.

## Bumped minimal Linux requirement

KAG is now built to target Ubuntu 18.04.  
This should not cause issues, but you may need to upgrade to a newer version if you are running on an ancient Linux distribution that ships a libc or libstdc++ version that we do not support.
